# Intake/SOW Operator Runbook (Derived)

> **Derived from canonical capsules:**

> This file is a derived operator view for provenance only. Canonical source of truth for Intake/SOW operations lives in `Automation_Protocols`.

Status: draft
Version: v1
Capsule Type: intake-sow-derived

This capsule provides an operator-focused summary of Intake/SOW runbook steps. It must not be edited as the primary runbook; instead, edits should be applied to the canonical runbooks in `Automation_Protocols` and, if needed, reflected here.

---

## 1. Canonical Runbook Sources

- Repository: `timbuilt-DB/Automation_Protocols`
- Pipeline capsule: `active/5xx_Pipelines/intake-sow-pipeline.md`
- Runbooks: `active/4xx_Runbooks/*.md` (as applicable)

Operators should treat those files as the definitive source for Intake/SOW procedures.

---

## 2. Role of This Derived Capsule

- Summarizes key operator steps for provenance and quick reference.
- May be used in conjunction with fixtures and health checks, but not as the source of truth.

For full operational logic and exceptions, refer to the canonical runbooks in `Automation_Protocols`.

---

## 3. Governance Note

- Do not add new canonical Intake/SOW operational logic here.
- For any changes to operator procedures, update the relevant runbooks in `Automation_Protocols`, then refresh this derived view via PR if desired.
